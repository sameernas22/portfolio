    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Sameer Khan, a final year student at St. Martin's Engineering College pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication. While studying, I have developed a keen interest in front-end web development, and I have been building my skillset in this field for the past 2 years.
        <br>
        <br>
        My journey in web development started as a hobby, where I started building websites for friends and family. Over time, my passion for coding and my love for designing user interfaces grew, and I decided to pursue it as a career. I started exploring various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end frameworks, to create aesthetically pleasing, functional, and responsive websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my academic career, I have worked on several projects related to front-end development, including creating websites for local businesses. I have also participated in various coding competitions and hackathons, where I have developed my skills and learned from my peers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides coding, I enjoy listening to music, reading books, and exploring new places. I am a quick learner, and I am always eager to explore new technologies and expand my knowledge. I am excited to use my skills and passion for web development to help create better user experiences, and I am looking forward to the opportunities that come my way.</p>
